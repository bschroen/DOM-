            Maple Cinnamon Spider Web Fritters</h2>
        <div class="close">
            <img src="images/fritter.jpg" />
            <p><b>Directions</b></p>
            <p>Pour enough oil in a large skillet so it's about 1 inch deep. Heat oil over medium-high heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers between 280 to 300 degree F. </p>
            <p>Meanwhile, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the center; add the milk, egg, and 1 tablespoon maple syrup. Whisk the dry and wet ingredients together until smooth.</p>
            <p>Transfer batter into a large size pastry bag with a # 3 or 4 open tip. Carefully squeeze batter in a circular pattern and then back and forth into the oil, to make a free form spider web-like design, about 3 to 4 inches in diameter. Cook until bottoms are golden, about 2 minutes. Using tongs or slotted spoon, turn fritters over and cook until golden on other side, about 1 minute more. Transfer the fritters to paper towels to drain briefly. Brush lightly with maple syrup and dust with confectioners' sugar. Repeat with remaining batter. Serve warm or at room temperature alone or with the garnishes.</p>

         Witch's Brew</h2>
        <div class="close">
            <p>Pour the gelatin mix into a large bowl. Slowly stir in the boiling water. Stir at least 2 minutes, until the gelatin is completely dissolved. Stir in the pineapple juice. Let cool to room temperature. </p>
            <p>Wearing heavy duty gloves or using tongs, place the block of dry ice in the bottom of the cauldron. (Dry ice will burn skin, so handle it with gloves and tongs and keep it away from kids and pets!) </p>
            <p>Use an ice pick to break the block into smaller chunks, if necessary. </p>
            <p>Fill the cauldron with just enough water to cover the dry ice. It will begin to "steam." </p>
            <p>Place the punch bowl inside the cauldron, on top of the dry ice. The cauldron will appear to be magically smoking. </p>
            <p>Entrap the sterilized rubber hand between the cauldron and the punch bowl, squeezing it tight so the hand appears to be reaching out of the mist for help. Hot-glue the hand to the cauldron, if necessary, to hold it in place. </p>
            <p>Carefully pour the drink mixture into the punch bowl. Slowly add the chilled vodka and lemon-lime soda or ginger ale. Stir gently to mix.</p>

            <p>Spread out the black sugar on a small plate. Rub the lime wedge around the rim of a rocks glass; dip the glass in the black sugar, then fill with ice. </p>
            <p>Combine the rum and lime juice in a cocktail shaker. Fill with ice and shake well. Carefully strain into the glass, minding the sugar on the rim. Top the drink with ginger beer and add the gummy spider.</p>

        Deviled Chicken Lollipops</h2>
        <div class="close">
        <img src="images/chicken.jpg"/>
            <p>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F or a convection oven to 425 degrees F. </p>
            <p>Stand a drumette on its wide end and, holding the narrow bone at the top, use a paring knife to push and scrape the skin and meat downward to expose the bone and make a plump "lollipop" of chicken at the bottom. Repeat with the remaining drumettes. Season generously with salt and pepper and set aside. </p>
            <p>Pulse the bread in a food processor to make coarse bread crumbs, (about 12 times). Add the garlic, parsley, scallions, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, to taste, and continue to pulse until finely chopped but not a paste. Transfer the mixture to a shallow bowl and toss with melted butter. </p>
            <p>Brush each drumette with some honey mustard. Then press and roll each one in the bread crumbs to coat. Arrange the drumettes (standing up if you can) on a rack set over a baking sheet. Roast until chicken is cooked and the bread crumbs are golden brown and crisp, 20 to 25 minutes. Serve drumettes hot or at room temperature with hot sauce, if desired. </p>
